# Contact-Form-with-JavaScript-Validation
This project is a simple and responsive Contact Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It includes client-side validation to ensure that:
- Name, Email, and Message fields are not empty.
- Email is entered in a valid format using Regex.
- Error messages are shown instantly if inputs are invalid.
- A success message is displayed if all inputs are valid (no actual sending).
